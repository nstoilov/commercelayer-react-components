# Order List

This guide will explain how to create an order list page using the Commerce Layer components.

The order list will be rendered as a sortable table, depending on the data you want to display and use as columuns.
You might want to use this component to render a list of user's orders in their account page.


### Full example
The list is mainly composed by two components: `OrderList` and `OrderListRow` and works around the `order` object.

- You can specify the `columns` you need to handle using the relative props in `<OrderList>`. Each columns is linked to a 
- Each value is then rendered with a `<OrderListRow>` component, which is a `<td>` element attached to a specific `field` of the order object.


<span title="Rendering custom cell value" type="info">
`<OrderListRow>` works out the box by automatically render the value of the field in a `<td>` tag, 
but you can also use `children` prop to customize the output that will be rendered inside the `<td>` tag.
Just remember that you don't have to write the `<td>` tag, **but only the content**.
<br/><br/>
In the following example you can notice that the `number` column uses a custom children render, while content of other cells is rendered with the default values.
</span>
